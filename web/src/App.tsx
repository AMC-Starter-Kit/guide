          <div>The American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) are a series of math contests aimed at middle and high school students in the United States. Organized by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), the AMC program helps students develop problem-solving skills and fosters interest in mathematics.

Here's a quick overview of the AMC series:

AMC 8: For students in grade 8 and below, this test covers foundational math topics, focusing on algebra, geometry, counting, and basic problem-solving skills. It is a 25-question, multiple-choice test taken in 40 minutes.

AMC 10: Designed for students in grade 10 or below, the AMC 10 emphasizes advanced problem-solving, covering more in-depth algebra and geometry, along with some probability and number theory. It's a 25-question, 75-minute multiple-choice exam.

AMC 12: For students in grade 12 and below, the AMC 12 is similar to the AMC 10 in format but covers a broader range of math topics, including trigonometry, logarithms, and some introductory calculus.

High-scoring students from the AMC 10 and AMC 12 can qualify for the AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination), which is the next step in the path toward prestigious math competitions such as the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO). This progression provides a structured path for students interested in developing and showcasing their mathematical skills. </div>
